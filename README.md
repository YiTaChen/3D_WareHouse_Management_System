## üö© Problem Statement

Traditional Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) usually provide text-based inventory data and, at most, 2D layouts. However, locating items in physical warehouses remains challenging.  
For example:  
> "Tissue is located on the 2nd floor of Warehouse #2, aisle 15, shelf level 5, section 3."  

This system addresses the challenge by offering a **3D web-based visualization** of warehouse operations and inventory.

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema Overview

This project uses a relational database structure designed for clarity, extensibility, and 3D inventory visualization. The core tables include:

- **boxes**: Basic unit for inventory, each with a unique `box_id`.
- **boxContents**: Defines the relationship between boxes and stored items, including quantity and soft-delete status.
- **boxPositions**: Stores spatial coordinates (`x, y, z`) of each box in the 3D warehouse.
- **items**: Master table of all item definitions.

### Relationships:

- One **box** has one **boxPosition**
- One **box** has many **boxContents**
- One **item** can be in many **boxContents**

All relationships are enforced with Sequelize associations and proper foreign key constraints.
