# 1. Project Title:

    3D Warehouse Management Web System (3D-WMS)
    
![Demo](./demo_resource_for_readme/3d_demo-3.gif)

**Latest version:** 0.3  
👉 Try it yourself: [Live Demo on Firebase](https://r3f-gravity-apply-test.firebaseapp.com)


# 2. Problem Statement:

    Most traditional WMS provide summary and data. And a few of them have 2D map for the warehouse. 
But users are hard to find the correct location, when it comes to reality.

    ex: The Tissue is situated on the second floor of 2nd Warehouse, in aisle 15, shelf level 5 and 3 section.
    So we provide 3D warehouse management web system for solving this problem.

# 3. Overview of the Application’s Functionality:

    Interactive 3D warehouse view for users. 
    Execute inventory inbound and outbound processes, and user can see the process simulation in 3D model.
    provide basic traditional WMS system functions. Ex: Inventory search, summary.
