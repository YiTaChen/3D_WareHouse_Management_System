#1. Project Title:
    3D Warehouse Management Web System (3D-WMS)
#2. Problem Statement:
    Most traditional WMS provide summary and data. And a few of them have 2D map for the warehouse. 
    But users are hard to find the correct location, when it comes to reality.
    ex: The Tissue is situated on the second floor of 2nd Warehouse, in aisle 15, shelf level 5 and 3 section.
    So we provide 3D warehouse management web system for solving this problem.

#3. Overview of the Application’s Functionality:
    Interactive 3D warehouse view for users. 
    Execute inventory inbound and outbound processes, and user can see the process simulation in 3D model.
    provide basic traditional WMS system functions. Ex: Inventory search, summary.
